**Summary of Statistical Distributions**

## **1. Bernoulli Distribution**
- Models a **single** binary trial (Success/Failure, 1/0).
- PMF: $` P(X = x) = p^x (1 - p)^{1 - x} `$, where $` x \in \{0,1\} `$.
- **Mean**: $` p `$, **Variance**: $` p(1 - p) `$.
- **Applications**: Coin flips, success/failure trials, binary classification in ML.

## **2. Binomial Distribution**
- Models the number of successes in **n independent** Bernoulli trials.
- PMF: $` P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} `$.
- **Mean**: $` np `$, **Variance**: $` np(1 - p) `$.
- **Applications**:
  - Counting heads in coin flips.
  - Quality control (e.g., defective items in a batch).
  - Number of successes in clinical trials.
  - Logistic regression (binary classification models in ML).

### **Statistical Tests Involving Binomial Distribution**
- **Binomial Test**: Compares observed vs. expected success probability.
- **Z-Test for Proportions**: Approximate test for large sample sizes.
- **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**: Checks if data follows a Binomial distribution.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used in ML for binary classification problems.

## **3. Chi-Square Tests & Their Relationship to Binomial Data**
- **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**: Compares observed categorical data to expected counts (e.g., testing if defect rates follow a Binomial model).
- **Chi-Square Test for Independence**: Used for contingency tables (e.g., checking if two categorical variables are independent, such as email version vs. open rates).
- **Applications**:
  - A/B testing.
  - Evaluating independence between two categorical variables.
  - Checking if a sample follows an expected probability model.

**Understanding the Relationship Between Poisson, Exponential, and Negative Binomial Distributions**

### **Poisson Distribution**
The **Poisson distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming these events happen independently at a constant average rate.

#### **Mathematical Definition**
A Poisson-distributed random variable $` X `$ with rate $` \lambda `$ follows:

```math
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}, \quad k = 0,1,2, \dots
```

where:
- $` \lambda `$ is the expected number of events in the interval,
- $` k! `$ is the factorial of $` k `$,
- $` e `$ is Euler’s number.

#### **Key Properties**
- **Mean**: $` E[X] = \lambda `$
- **Variance**: $` \text{Var}(X) = \lambda `$
- **Mode**: $` \lfloor \lambda \rfloor `$ or $` \lfloor \lambda \rfloor -1 `$

#### **Applications in Computational Biology**
- **RNA-Seq Data & Gene Expression**: Models discrete read counts.
- **Mutation Modeling**: Models the total number of mutations per genome region.
- **Single-Cell Data Analysis**: Can model lowly expressed genes in single-cell RNA-Seq.

### **Relationship Between Poisson, Exponential, and Negative Binomial Distributions**

#### **Poisson and Exponential: Counting vs. Waiting Time**
- The **Poisson distribution** models the **number of discrete events** occurring in a fixed time or space interval.
- The **Exponential distribution** models the **waiting time between consecutive Poisson-distributed events**.

##### **Mathematical Relationship**
If events occur according to a Poisson process with rate $` \lambda `$, then:
- The **number of events** in a fixed interval follows a **Poisson($` \lambda t `$)** distribution.
- The **time between consecutive events** follows an **Exponential($` \lambda `$)** distribution:
  
```math
  P(T > t) = e^{-\lambda t}, \quad T \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)
```

##### **Applications in Computational Biology**
- **RNA-Seq & Single-Cell Data**: Poisson models counts, exponential models time to transcriptional events.
- **Mutation Modeling**: Poisson models the number of mutations, exponential models waiting time between mutations.
- **Protein Turnover**: Exponential models waiting time for molecule degradation.

#### **Poisson and Negative Binomial: Overdispersion**
- The **Poisson distribution** assumes $` \text{Var}(X) = E[X] = \lambda `$.
- **Negative Binomial (NB)** allows variance to exceed the mean (**overdispersion**):

```math
  \text{Var}(X) = \mu + \frac{\mu^2}{r}
```

  where:
  - $` \mu `$ is the mean count,
  - $` r `$ (or $` \theta `$) is the **overdispersion parameter**.

##### **Applications in Computational Biology**
- **RNA-Seq Gene Expression**: More flexible than Poisson due to biological variability.
- **Modeling Rare Disease Incidence**: Better accounts for variability across individuals.
- **ChIP-Seq & Peak Calling**: Captures overdispersed read counts across genomic regions.

### **What is Overdispersion?**
**Overdispersion** occurs when the observed variance exceeds what is expected under a Poisson model:

```math
\text{Var}(X) > E[X]
```

In the **Negative Binomial distribution**, the variance formula:

```math
\text{Var}(X) = \mu + \frac{\mu^2}{r}
```

shows that smaller $` r `$ leads to higher overdispersion.

##### **Biological Interpretation**
- **Small $` r `$** → High dispersion (more variable gene expression counts).
- **Large $` r `$** → Approaches Poisson (less variance, more regular counts).

---

### **Negative Binomial as a Limit of Poisson**
As the number of trials in a **Negative Binomial process** grows very large ($` r \to \infty `$) and the success probability $` p \to 0 `$ while keeping $` \lambda = r(1 - p) `$ fixed, the distribution converges to **Poisson**:

```math
P(X = k) \approx \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
```

##### **Implications in Biology**
- **Mutation Modeling**: Mutation counts often follow Poisson unless overdispersion is present.
- **Gene Expression in RNA-Seq**: NB captures variability better than Poisson due to transcriptional bursts.

### **Two Parameterizations of the Negative Binomial Distribution**

1. **Classic NB(r, p) (Bernoulli Trials Interpretation)**
   - Models **failures before the $` r `$th success**.
   - Uses parameters $` r `$ (success count) and $` p `$ (success probability).
   
```math
   P(X = k) = \binom{k + r - 1}{k} (1 - p)^k p^r
```

2. **Dispersion-Based NB(μ, θ) (Poisson-Gamma Interpretation)**
   - Models **overdispersed count data**.
   - Uses $` μ `$ (mean count) and $` θ `$ (dispersion parameter).
   
```math
   P(X = k) = \frac{\Gamma(k + \theta)}{k! \Gamma(\theta)} \left( \frac{\theta}{\theta + \mu} \right)^{\theta} \left( \frac{\mu}{\theta + \mu} \right)^k
```

##### **Key Differences**
- **Classic NB**: Discrete number of successes, integer-valued $` r `$.
- **Dispersion-Based NB**: Continuous dispersion parameter $` \theta `$, more flexible for real-world data.

##### **Biological Interpretation**
- **Classic NB**: Less common in bioinformatics.
- **Dispersion-Based NB**: Preferred in RNA-Seq, mutation modeling, and overdispersed count data.

### **Final Takeaways**
- **Poisson models rare events** but assumes variance equals the mean.
- **Exponential describes waiting times** between Poisson events.
- **Negative Binomial generalizes Poisson** by introducing an overdispersion parameter.
- **In computational biology**, NB is preferred for count data analysis due to its ability to handle extra variance.
